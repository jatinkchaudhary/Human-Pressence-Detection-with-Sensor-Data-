# Human-Pressence-Detection-with-Sensor-Data-

Multilayer Perceptron Algorithm was used to detect the presence of human. The model was trained using Omron D6T-44L06 thermal sensor data and later, the model was implemented on audino nano for live validation and testing.

The research was published at the 7th IEEE World Forum on Internet of Things, USA as a paper presentation entitled, "Human Presence Detection with Thermal Sensor
using Multilayer Perceptron Algorithm".

The paper will soon be published on IEEE Xplore.
